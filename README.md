Experimentation with Linux kernel modules to try and learn more about how the kernel works.

Ongoing series of blog posts on rootkit techniques can be found [here](https://xcellerator.github.io/).

Educational purposes only.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 16.04,via Vagrant - should work on most kernels.
